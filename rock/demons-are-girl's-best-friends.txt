Beware the night
Beware the night before the dawn
Beware the dark when light is gone
For there's a phantom lust to wake
They wanna make you bend and scream
They wanna take your hand and lead you in the light of Venus, girl
Come let them take you for a ride
Forget the lord and cross tonight
And let your carnal lust prevail tonight
Oh, demons come at night and they bring the end
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
Oh, demons come alive and they take command
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
Beware the fire
Beware the fire in their eyes
Beware the hormone-driven lies
For there's a truth behind the veil
They make you part of blackened rites
Protect the grail between your thighs
Your antidote of evil, girl
Come resurrect him to the sky
And wave all innocence goodbye
And let desire take command tonight
Oh, demons come at night and they bring the end
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
Oh, demons come alive and they take command
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
And when your sleep is haunted in the night
Girl, don't you dare to seek for candle light
Cause in the dark your demons come as carnal dynamite
Oh, demons of the night come and take her hand
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
Oh, demon 'tween your thighs, come and make their stand
Come and make their stand
Oh, demons are a girl's best friend
