We remember, no surrender
Heroes of our century
Three men stood strong and they held out for long
Going into the fight to their death that awaits
Crazy or brave, will it end in the grave?
As they're giving their lives
As their honor dictates
Far, far from home to a war
Fought on foreign soil and far
Far from known tell their tale
Their forgotten story
Cobras Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória
Rise from the blood of your heroes
You, were the ones who refused to surrender
The three rather died than to flee
Know that your memory
Will be sung for a century
Three took the blow while impressing their foe
Throwing dice with their lives as they're paying the price
Sent to raise hell, hear the toll of the bell
It is calling for you as the Wehrmacht devised
Far, far from home to a war
Fought on foreign soil and far
Far from known tell their tale
Their forgotten story
Cobras Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória
Rise from the blood of your heroes
You, were the ones who refused to surrender
The three rather died than to flee
Know that your memory
Will be sung for a century
Sent over seas to be cast into fire
Fought for a purpose with pride and desire
Blood of the brave they would give to inspire
Cobras Fumantes, your memory lives
Sent over seas to be cast into fire
Fought for a purpose with pride and desire
Blood of the brave they would give to inspire
Cobras Fumantes, your memory lives
Cobras Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória
Rise from the blood of your heroes
You, were the ones who refused to surrender
The three rather died than to flee
Know that your memory
Will be sung for a century
We remember, no surrender
